## My process 

- I approached the respective challenge with the following strategy : 
  1. Individually build the components to completion with HTML & CSS, followed by applying media query to view the optimal layout for interface depending upon device screen size.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS custom properties.
- Flexbox.
- Media query.

### What I learned

- Usage of media query(from pure CSS perspective).


### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp - This helped me with Media query. I've used media query with Chakra UI - really wanted to use with pure CSS rather than completly relying on a framework.
